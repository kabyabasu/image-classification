Image Classification with Tensorflow
In this project, have classified images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. I have preprocessed the images, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. The images needed to be normalized and the labels needed to be one-hot encoded. I build a CNN with convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers.

You need python2.7 or later to run this file.
